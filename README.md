# Disney Movies and Box Office Success

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. This project, one of the many from Datacamp, analyzes data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. Hypothesis testing is also performed to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
